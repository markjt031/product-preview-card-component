## My process

I started by trying to get the mobile design as close as possible to the original and trying to avoid using exact pixel units. This
process of doing the mobile design first made creating the desktop display much easier.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I used this project to learn how to calculate REM and EM for font sizes and percentages for margins, which turned out to be much easier than I thought it was.
