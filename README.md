## My process

I started by trying to get the mobile design as close as possible to the original. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I used this project to learn how to calculate REM, EM and margin percentages, which turned out to be much easier than I thought it was.
